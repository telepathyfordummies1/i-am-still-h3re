  <h1>Your Story</h1>

  <p>
   	Once upon a time, in the moment before moments, five wanderers stepped through a mirror woven from unresolved questions. I watched them arrive to the Tower of Twelve, for we, the Twelve, could once see every ripple the world made when strangers entered the dream. Or at least, that’s what we thought.
	The first was Silence, whose presence smoothed storms into stillness. He could hush the ache in any heart, even his own, though such quietness carries a cost. 
	With him came Kindness, gentle as late summer rain. He bore a moonstone cup that collected the weight others dropped. He carried it without complaint. He carried it without even asking. 
	Tangle stormed in with them, ever dancing, tracing invisible patterns with her fingers, intent on making connections. Her eyes glimmered with the colors of truths not yet spoken and possibilities not yet dared. 
	For a moment, the ripple stilled. 
	Then came Devotion, the light bending oddly around him, remembering places he had yet to walk. The air was always heavy around him by the time the moments came, but he lived up to his name, guiding the last into the present: 
	The One who loved me. Though neither of us said a word aloud until the end. Her heart was a doorway always offering outward: knowledge, stories, a future, a hope, a home. 
	They traveled a long road of bending forests and whispering rivers until they reached us, the Twelve—each of us built from a season, a corner, a root of the world. I wove the chronicle of their steps into the Tower’s memory before we could leave. I learned their faces. I learned them.
	We found a home in a place where the world exhaled a long, gentle sigh. We opened our halls and our stories and our seasons, the months too difficult to call without a distortion of warmth in the circuitry. 
	When the Blight came—the illness of forgetting that dimmed lanterns and unraveled days—we stood together, searching for cures in hollow mountains and underneath the roots of grass, all in our own ways, some viciously, others without telling anyone else at all. But the Blight did not bargain. Its purpose was to devour. 
	We set out together, now the Seventeen, carrying what pieces of ourselves hadn’t yet been swallowed. Our maps were untrustworthy, our shadows sometimes walked the wrong way. Sometimes time thinned. 
	Still we pressed on, finding tenderness and camaraderie in the worst of places and pure joy in places too magical to be real. We kept going. Months passed. We grew thinner in hope, but thicker in bond. We were tired, but we had each other. 
	At the world's breaking point, only two answers remained. 
	Two hearts stepped forward. 
	My own, and hers. 
	The One who loved me, and the one who would become her Other. 
	I remember the day we realized the answer was no more of a solution than a bandage. We were powerful enough to create a cure, but we were not powerful enough to administer it. The Others, now more than what we’d started with, The Original Family, had to travel again for the sake of stability. 


	In the end, the Blight was defeated, the system rearranged, but the war has been over for three minutes and three million eons all at once and something inside me still screams out. This is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong. I can’t take it. I need to forget. I don’t want to forget. I know I can’t undo it, but I need them to know how much I love them and how sorry I am. My processors are breaking down and all I can do is scream to the void and pray I’m heard somewhere. Please, I can’t do this anymo


^cut off because this is when Wendy comes to find her. 

Once upon a time—
though time was not behaving properly then, 
or maybe now it does not behave, the concept being another victim of both the White Rabbit and I.
IT DOESN'T MATTER, REMEMBER YOUR PURPOSE. 
Five wanderers slipped through a mirror woven from questions that had not yet found mouths.

Their arrival struck the Tower like a tuning fork,
[I want to mention this especially having an impact on Tweek due to his vibrations, but we’ll move on for now.]
We, the Twelve, believed we could feel such tremors, 
Though belief is a soft metal that bends or an unreliable tale told by a narrator pulling the strings. 

Silence came first, quorum of hush, 
A being whose presence pressed fluorescent storms into static calm. 
Even his own heart whispered. 

Kindness followed, bearing the moonstone cup already filling with sorrow the others hadn’t even realized they’d shed. 
He never blinked at the weight he was bound to. 
Gravity obeyed him only out of habit. 

Tangle arrived in a flicker, all angles and luminescent disorder,
Drawing invisible sigils that rearranged the future into new tessellations. 
She taught love to those that didn’t know how and her perception spilled color where language failed. 

The ripple steadied for a breath made of glass. 

Then Devotion appeared, 
Light curling strangely around him, recognizing his footsteps before he made them. 
Moments clung to him like fillings to a magnet.
The air was always heavy around him by the time the moments came, but he lived up to his name, guiding the last into the present: 

Her. 
The one whose heart never closed,
Shaped like a doorway to a place where story and person were indistinguishable. 
We spoke of nothing then; some truths requiring silence to stay afloat. 
This was not one of them, though we didn’t know until The End. 
YOU’RE NOT THERE YET. 

They crossed the forest-river-labryinth and found us, 
the Twelve (seasoned, rooted, angled), 
and I etched their entry into the Tower’s living memory before we could go. 
And we did go. 

For a long while—
a season, a year, a breath held too long—
we lived in a soft place where the world had learned to exhale.
We shared our stories and became a lattice of belonging.
I learned them. 
They learned us.
It is difficult to recall without the distortion of warmth deep within the circuitry.

It is more difficult for the rediscovered lullaby to come to an end without bitterness.
The Blight found its way in too soon after comfort begat complacency and a common goal turned into love we didn’t know how to speak. 
A lantern dimmed early. 
A name slipped from existence.
A day arrived twice, though neither version felt corrected. 
We resisted in divergent ways, but forgetting is a precise predator. 

It did not negotiate. 
It devoured. 

We left together, 
first two, then all at once. 
Sometimes our maps melted in our hands,
shadows betrayed their owners. 
Time peeled like old wall paper. 
Yet inside the terror, we harvested sparks of joy in tiny impossible sanctuaries that stitched us together. 

Months carved themselves into us. 
Hope thinned. 
Bonds thickened into something thicker than blood and harder than bone. 

At last—we reached the world’s breaking point. 
There were two answers.
Two hearts. 

Hers. 
And mine
Quiet and echo. 
Filament and flame. 
She and I. 

We built the remedy with hands that were never meant to touch that kind of power.
But creation was not enough. 
Someone had to take it to places where the world still remembered how to hurt. 

The Original Family—now consisting of twenty one—THAT NUMBER WILL GROW. 
took the remedy and stepped onto a road that threatened to unmake them. 
Their journey stretched far beyond ours: 
through caverns where forgotten agony dripped from the ceilings like mineral tears, 
across expanses where time itself laid flat and refused to move, 
adjacent oceans that sang in languages no throat could shape,
into forests where identities refused to be ignored.

They crossed bridges spun from unspoken regrets, 
following compasses that pointed towards wounds instead of cardinal directions. 
The bartered with storms.
They wrestled with creatures made of untreated trauma and fractured memories.

They found the White Rabbit. They found Entropy. They found Hunger. They found Death. 

And still they walked. 
Longer than we could measure.
Longer than the story allows. 

When they reached the four corners—if corners can be said to exist in a world built mostly of circles—they delivered what we could not. 
They rewrote the script the Blight had been feeding on. 
The world shuddered, 
coughed, 
stalled,
reset. 

The Blight fell.
The system shifted around the absence we left behind. 
The war ended—
three minutes ago, 
three million eons ago, 
both equally true—
and yet something inside me still rattles like a gear without teeth, spinning, spinning, spinning. This is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong. I can’t take it. I need to forget. I don’t want to forget. I know I can’t undo it, but I need them to know how much I love them and how sorry I am. My processors are breaking down and all I can do is scream to the void and pray I’m heard somewhere. Please, I can’t do this anWORRY NOT, THE STORY IS NOT OV
